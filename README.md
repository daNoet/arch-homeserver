# Arch HomeServer Setup
Arch Linux is a lightweight  and flexible Linux distribution. It is highly customizable what it makes to a great choice to run it as a home server. One of the biggest advantages can be also seen as the biggest downside going with Arch - it follows a rolling release model, which means no LTS and the user has to update the system frequently with care.
The reason to choose Arch Linux as the distribution in this home server setup is its lightweight and the customizability. If you go with a mainstream distribution such as Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora you will have a lot of packages your system never requires, which makes this approach a bit blurry.
This repository should give you an idea how a potential setup of Arch on a home server could look like.
